    <p>
      Some men deliberately don a character in early youth as others don a mask
      before going to an opera ball. They select it not without some care, being
      guided in their choice by the opinion they have formed of the world&rsquo;s mind
      and manner of proceeding. In the privacy of the dressing-room, the candles
      being lighted and the mirror adjusted at the best angle for a view of
      self, they assume their character, and peacock to their reflection,
      meditating: Does it become me? Will it be generally liked? Will it advance
      me towards my heart&rsquo;s desire? Then they catch up their cloak, twist the
      mirror back to its usual position, puff out the candles, and steal forth
      into their career, shutting the door gently behind them. And, perhaps till
      they are laid out in the grave, the last four walls enclosing them, only
      the dressing-room could tell their secret. And it has no voice to speak.
      For, if they are wise, they do not keep a valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of sixteen Eustace Lane chose his mask, lit the candles, tried
      it on, and resolved to wear it at the great masquerade. He was an Eton boy
      at the time. One fourth of June he was out in the playing-fields, paying
      polite attentions to another fellow&rsquo;s sister, when he overheard a fragment
      of a conversation that was taking place between his mother and one of the
      masters. His mother was a kind Englishwoman, who was very short-sighted,
      and always did her duty. The master was a fool, but as he was tall,
      handsome, and extremely good-natured, Eustace Lane and most people
      considered him to be highly intelligent. Eustace caught the sound of his
      name pronounced. The fond mother, in the course of discreet conversation,
      had proceeded from the state of the weather to the state of her boy&rsquo;s
      soul, taking, with the ease of the mediocre, the one step between the
      sublime and the ridiculous. She had told the master the state of the
      weather&mdash;which, for once, was sublime; she wanted him, in return, to
      tell her the state of her boy&rsquo;s soul&mdash;which was ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustace forgot the other fellow&rsquo;s sister, her limpid eyes, her open-worked
      stockings, her panoply of chiffons and of charms. He had heard his own
      name. Bang went the door on the rest of the world, shutting out even
      feminine humanity. Self-consciousness held him listening. His mother said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Eustace! What do you think of him, Mr. Bembridge? Is he <i>really</i>
      clever? His father and I consider him unusually intelligent for his age&mdash;so
      advanced in mind. He judges for himself, you know. He always did, even as
      a baby. I remember when he was quite a tiny mite I could always trust to
      his perceptions. In my choice of nurses I was invariably guided by him. If
      he screamed at them I felt that there was something wrong, and dismissed
      them&mdash;of course with a character. If he smiled at them, I knew I
      could have confidence in their virtue. How strange these things are! What
      is it in us that screams at evil and smiles at good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what, indeed?&rdquo; replied the master, accepting her conclusion as an
      established and very beautiful fact. &ldquo;There is more in the human heart
      than you and I can fathom, Mrs. Lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed! But tell me about Eustace. You have observed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carefully. He is a strange boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whimsical, I mean. How clever he may be I am unable to say. He is so
      young, and, of course, undeveloped. But he is an original. Even if he
      never displays great talents the world will talk about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Lane in some alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be talked about was, she considered, to be the prey of scandalmongers.
      She did not wish to give her darling to the lions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that Eustace has a strain of quaint fun in him&mdash;a sort of
      passion for the burlesque of life. You do not often find this in boys. It
      is new to my experience. He sees the peculiar side of everything with a
      curious acuteness. Life presents itself to him in caricature. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      Well hit! Well hit indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Someone had scored a four.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other fellow&rsquo;s sister insisted on moving to a place whence they could
      see the cricket better, and Eustace had to yield to her. But from that
      moment he took no more interest in her artless remarks and her artful
      open-worked stockings. In the combat between self and her she went to the
      wall. He stood up before the mirror looking steadfastly at his own image.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, finding it not quite so interestingly curious as the fool of a master
      had declared it to be, he lit some more candies, selected a mask, and put
      it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chose the mask of a buffoon.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      From that day Eustace strove consistently to live up to the reputation
      given to him by a fool, who had been talking at random to please an avid
      mother. Mr. Bembridge knew that the boy was no good at work, wanted to say
      something nice about him, and had once noticed him playing some absurd but
      very ordinary boyish prank. On this supposed hint of character the master
      spoke. Mrs. Lane listened. Eustace acted. A sudden ambition stirred within
      him. To be known, talked about, considered, perhaps even wondered at&mdash;was
      not that a glory? Such a glory came to the greatly talented&mdash;to the
      mightily industrious. Men earned it by labour, by intensity, insensibility
      to fatigue, the &ldquo;roughing it&rdquo; of the mind. He did not want to rough it.
      Nor was he greatly talented. But he was just sharp enough to see, as he
      believed, a short and perhaps easy way to a thing that his conceit desired
      and that his egoism felt it could love. Being only a boy, he had never,
      till this time, deliberately looked on life as anything. Now he set
      himself, in his, at first, youthful way, to look on it as burlesque&mdash;to
      see it in caricature. How to do that? He studied the cartoons in <i>Vanity
      Fair</i>, the wondrous noses, the astounding trousers, that delight the
      cynical world. Were men indeed like these? Did they assume such postures,
      stare with such eyes, revel in such complexions? These were the
      celebrities of the time. They all looked with one accord preposterous.
      Eustace jumped to the conclusion that they were what they looked, and,
      going a step farther, that they were celebrated because they were
      preposterous. Gifted with a certain amount of imagination, this idea of
      the interest, almost the beauty of the preposterous, took a firm hold of
      his mind. One day he, too, would be in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, displaying
      terrific boots, amazing thin legs, a fatuous or a frenetic countenance to
      the great world of the unknown. He would stand out from the multitude if
      only by virtue of an unusual eyeglass, a particular glove, the fashion of
      his tie or of his temper. He would balance on the ball of peculiarity, and
      toe his way up the spiral of fame, while the music-hall audience applauded
      and the managers consulted as to the increase of his salary. Mr. Bembridge
      had shown him a weapon with which he might fight his way quickly to the
      front. He picked it up and resolved to use it. Soon he began to slash out
      right and left. His blade chanced to encounter the outraged body of an
      elderly and sardonic master. Eustace was advised that he had better leave
      Eton. His father came down by train and took him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they journeyed up to town, Mr. Lane lectured and exhorted, and Eustace
      looked out of the window. Already he felt himself near to being a
      celebrity. He had astonished Eton. That was a good beginning. Papa might
      prose, knowing, of course, nothing of the poetry of caricature, of the
      wild joys and the laurels that crown the whimsical. So while Mr. Lane
      hunted adjectives, and ran sad-sounding and damnatory substantives to
      earth, Eustace hugged himself, and secretly chuckled over his pilgrim&rsquo;s
      progress towards the pages of <i>Vanity Fair</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace! Eustace! Are you listening to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what have you to say? What explanation have you to offer for your
      conduct? You have behaved like a buffoon, sir&mdash;d&rsquo;you hear me?&mdash;like
      a buffoon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce do you mean by &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eustace considered, while Mr. Lane puffed in the approved paternal fashion
      What did he mean? A sudden thought struck him. He became confidential.
      With an earnest gaze, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help doing what I did. I want to be like the other fellows,
      but somehow I can&rsquo;t. Something inside of me won&rsquo;t let me just go on as
      they do. I don&rsquo;t know why it is, but I feel as if I must do original
      things&mdash;things other people never do; it&mdash;it seems in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lane regarded him suspiciously, but Eustace had clear eyes, and knew,
      at least, how to look innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to knock it out of you,&rdquo; blustered the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could, father,&rdquo; the boy said. &ldquo;I know I hate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lane began to be really puzzled. There was something pathetic in the
      words, and especially in the way they were spoken. He stared at Eustace
      meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you hate it, do you?&rdquo; he said rather limply at last. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a
      step in the right direction, at any rate. Perhaps things might have been
      worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eustace did not assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were bad enough,&rdquo; he said, with a simulation of shame. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve
      been a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; Mr. Lane said, whirling, as paternal weathercocks will, to
      another point of the compass, &ldquo;never mind, my boy. Cheer up! You see your
      fault&mdash;that&rsquo;s the main thing. What&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank heaven!&rdquo; thought the boy, feeling almost great.
    </p>
    <p>
      How delicious is the irrevocable past&mdash;sometimes!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be more careful in future. Don&rsquo;t let your boyish desire for follies carry
      you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; was his son&rsquo;s mental rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I dare say you&rsquo;ll do good work in the world yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The train ran into Paddington Station on this sublime climax of
      fatherhood, and the further words of wisdom were jerked out of Mr. Lane
      during their passage to Carlton House Terrace in a four-wheeled cab.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an extraordinary person Mr. Eustace Lane is!&rdquo; said Winifred Ames to
      her particular friend and happy foil, Jane Fraser. &ldquo;All London is
      beginning to talk about him. I suppose he must be clever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, darling, very clever; otherwise, how could he possibly
      gain so much notice? Just think&mdash;why, there are millions of people in
      London, and I&rsquo;m sure only about a thousand of them, at most, attract any
      real attention. I think Mr. Eustace Lane is a genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really, Jenny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred mused for a moment. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be very interesting to marry a genius, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, enthralling, simply. And, then, so few people can do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it must be grand to do what hardly anybody can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the way of marrying, Jenny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any way,&rdquo; responded Miss Fraser, who was an enthusiast, and habitually
      sentimental. &ldquo;What would I give to do even one unique thing, or to marry
      even one unique person!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t marry two at the same time&mdash;in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England limits itself so terribly; but there is a broader time coming.
      Those who see it, and act upon what they see, are pioneers; Mr. Lane is a
      pioneer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think him rather extravagant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes. That is so splendid. I love the extravagance of genius, the
      barbaric lavishness of moral and intellectual supremacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether the supremacy of Eustace Lane is moral, or intellectual,
      or&mdash;neither?&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;There are so many different
      supremacies, aren&rsquo;t there? I suppose a man might be supreme merely as a&mdash;as
      a&mdash;well, an absurdity, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny smiled the watery smile of the sentimentalist; a glass of still
      lemonade washed with limelight might resemble it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace Lane likes you, Winnie,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; that is why I am wondering about him. One does wonder, you see,
      about the man one may possibly be going to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had never been such a man for Jane Fraser, so she said nothing, but
      succeeded in looking confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Winifred allowed her happy foil to lace her up. She was going to
      a ball given by the Lanes in Carlton House Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he will propose to you to-night,&rdquo; whispered Jane in a gush of
      excitement as the two girls walked down the stairs to the carriage. &ldquo;If he
      does, what will you say?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, darling, but surely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace is so odd. I can&rsquo;t make him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because he is a genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is certainly remarkable&mdash;in a way. Good-night, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage drove off, and the happy foil joined her maid, who was
      waiting to conduct her home. On the way they gossipped, and the maid
      expressed a belief that Mr. Lane was a fine young gentleman, but full of
      his goings-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane knew what she meant. Eustace had once kissed her publicly in Jane&rsquo;s
      presence, which deed the latter considered a stroke of genius, and the act
      of a true and courageous pioneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustace was now just twenty-two, and he had already partially succeeded in
      his ambition. His mask had deceived his world, and Mr. Bembridge&rsquo;s
      prophecy about him was beginning to be fulfilled. He had done nothing
      specially intellectual or athletic, was not particularly active either
      with limbs or brain; but people had begun to notice and to talk about him,
      to discuss him with a certain interest, even with a certain wonder. The
      newspapers occasionally mentioned him as a dandy, a fop, a whimsical,
      irresponsible creature, yet one whose vagaries were not entirely without
      interest. He had performed some extravagant antic in a cotillon, or worn
      some extraordinary coat. He had invented a new way of walking one season,
      and during another season, although in perfect health, he had never left
      the house, declaring that movement of any kind was ungentlemanly and
      ridiculous, and that an imitation of harem life was the uttermost bliss
      obtainable in London. His windows in Carlton House Terrace had been
      latticed, and when his friends came there to see him they found him lying,
      supported by cushions, on a prayer-carpet, eating Eastern sweetmeats from
      a silver box.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he soon began to tire of this deliberate imprisonment, and to reduce
      buffoonery to a modern science. His father was a rich man, and he was an
      only child. Therefore he was able to gratify the supposed whims, which
      were no whims at all. He could get up surprise parties, which really bored
      him, carry out elaborate practical jokes, give extraordinary
      entertainments at will. For his parents acquiesced in his absurdities,
      were even rather proud of them, thinking that he followed his
      Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp of a fancy because he was not less, but more, than other
      young men. In fact, they supposed he must be a genius because he was
      erratic. Many people are of the same opinion, and declare that a goose
      standing on its head must be a swan. By degrees Eustace Lane&rsquo;s practical
      jokes became a common topic of conversation in London, and smart circles
      were in a perpetual state of mild excitement as to what he would do next.
      It was said that he had put the latchkey of a Duchess down the back of a
      Commander-in-Chief; that he had once, in a country house, prepared an
      apple-pie bed for an Heir-apparent, and that he had declared he would
      journey to Rome next Easter in order to present a collection of penny toys
      to the Pope. Society loves folly if it is sufficiently blatant. The folly
      of Eustace was just blatant enough to be more than tolerated&mdash;enjoyed.
      He had by practice acquired a knack of being silly in unexpected ways, and
      so a great many people honestly considered him one of the cleverest young
      men in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, you know, it is the proper thing, if you wear a mask, to have a sad
      face behind it. Eustace sometimes felt sad, and sometimes fatigued. He had
      worked a little to make his reputation, but it was often hard labour to
      live up to it. His profession of a buffoon sometimes exhausted him, but he
      could no longer dare to be like others. The self-conscious live to gratify
      the changing expectations of their world, and Eustace had educated himself
      into a self-consciousness that was almost a disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, then, there was his place in the pages of <i>Vanity Fair</i> to be
      won. He put that in front of him as his aim in life, and became daily more
      and more whimsical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he did one prosaic thing. He fell in love with Winifred
      Ames, and could not help showing it. As the malady increased upon him his
      reputation began to suffer eclipse, for he relapsed into sentiment, and
      even allowed his eyes to grow large and lover-like. He ceased to worry
      people, and so began to bore them&mdash;a much more dangerous thing. For a
      moment he even ran the fearful risk of becoming wholly natural, dropping
      his mask, and showing himself as he really was, a rather dull, quite
      normal young man, with the usual notions about the usual things, the usual
      bias towards the usual vices, the usual disinclination to do the usual
      duties of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran a risk, but Winifred saved him, and restored him to his fantasies
      this evening of the ball in Carlton House Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an ordinary ball, and therefore Eustace appeared to receive his
      guests in fancy dress, wearing a powdered wig and a George IV. Court
      costume. This absurdity was a mechanical attempt to retrieve his buffoon&rsquo;s
      reputation, for he was really very much in love, and very serious in his
      desire to be married in quite the ordinary way. With a rather lack-lustre
      eye he noticed the amusement of his friends at his last vagary; but when
      Winifred Ames entered the ballroom a nervous vivacity shook him, as it has
      shaken ploughmen under similar conditions, and for just a moment he felt
      ill at ease in the lonely lunacy of his flowered waistcoat and olive-green
      knee-breeches. He danced with her, then took her to a scarlet nook,
      apparently devised to hold only one person, but into which they gently
      squeezed, not without difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him with her big brown eyes, that were at the same time
      honest and fanciful. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have taken an unfair advantage of us all to-night, Mr. Lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Havel? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By retreating into the picturesque clothes of another age. All the men
      here must hate you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; they only laugh at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a moment. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it in you that makes you enjoy that which the rest of us are
      afraid of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being laughed at. Laughter, you know, is the great world&rsquo;s
      cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails. We fear it as little boys fear the birch on a winter&rsquo;s
      morning at school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eustace smiled uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you laugh at me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. You surely don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, with an effort. Then: &ldquo;Are you laughing to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You have done an absurd thing, of course, but it happens to be
      becoming. You look&mdash;well, pretty&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s the word&mdash;in
      your wig. Many men are ugly in their own hair. And, after all, what would
      life be without its absurdities? Probably you are right to enjoy being
      laughed at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eustace, who had seriously meditated putting off his mask forever that
      night, began to change his mind. The sentence, &ldquo;Many men are ugly in their
      own hair,&rdquo; dwelt with him, and he felt fortified in his powdered wig. What
      if he took it off, and henceforth Winifred found him ugly? Does not the
      safety of many of us lie merely in dressing up? Do we not buy our fate at
      the costumier&rsquo;s?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just tell me one thing,&rdquo; Winifred went on. &ldquo;Are you natural?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natural?&rdquo; he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I think you must be. You&rsquo;ve got a whimsical nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; He thought of his journey with his father years ago, and
      added: &ldquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? There is a charm in the fantastic, although comparatively few people
      see it. Life must be a sort of Arabian Nights Entertainment to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes. To-night it is different. It seems a sort of Longfellow life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Real and earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he proposed to her, with a laugh, to shoot an arrow at the dead
      poet and his own secret psalm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Winifred accepted him, partly because she thought him really strange,
      partly because he seemed so pretty in his wig, which she chose to believe
      his own hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were married, and on the wedding-day the bridegroom astonished his
      guests by making a burlesque speech at the reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      In anyone else such an exhibition would have been considered the worst
      taste, but nobody was disgusted, and many were delighted. They had begun
      to fear that Eustace was getting humdrum. This harlequinade after the
      pantomime at the church&mdash;for what is a modern smart wedding but a
      second-rate pantomime?&mdash;put them into a good humour, and made them
      feel that, after all, they had got something for their presents. And so
      the happy pair passed through a dreary rain of rice to the mysteries of
      that Bluebeard&rsquo;s Chamber, the honeymoon.
    </p>

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Winifred anticipated this honeymoon with calmness, but Eustace was too
      much in love to be calm. He was, on the contrary, in a high state of
      excitement, and of emotion, and the effort of making his ridiculous speech
      had nearly sent him into hysterics. But he had now fully resolved to
      continue in his whimsical course, and to play for ever the part of a
      highly erratic genius, driven hither and thither by the weird impulses of
      the moment. That he never had any impulses but such as were common to most
      ordinary young men was a sad fact which he meant to most carefully conceal
      from Winifred. He had made up his mind that she believed his mask to be
      his face. She had, therefore, married the mask. To divorce her violently
      from it might be fatal to their happiness. If he showed the countenance
      God had given him, she might cry: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you. You are a stranger.
      You are like all the other men I didn&rsquo;t choose to marry.&rdquo; His blood ran
      cold at the thought. No, he must keep it up. She loved his fantasies
      because she believed them natural to him. She must never suspect that they
      were not natural. So, as they travelled, he planned the campaign of
      married life, as doubtless others, strange in their new bondage, have
      planned. He gazed at Winifred, and thought, &ldquo;What is her notion of the
      ideal husband, I wonder?&rdquo; She gazed at him, and mused on his affection and
      his whimsicality, and what the two would lead to in connection with her
      fate. And the old, scarlet-faced guard smiled fatuously at them both
      through the window on which glared a prominent &ldquo;Engaged&rdquo; as he had smiled
      on many another pair of fools&mdash;so he silently dubbed them. Then they
      entered Bluebeard&rsquo;s Chamber and closed the door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brighton was their destination. They meant to lose themselves in a marine
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stayed there for a fortnight, and then returned to town, Eustace more
      in love than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Winifred?
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon she sat in the drawing-room of the pretty little house they
      had taken in Deanery Street, Park Lane. She was thinking, very definitely.
      The silent processes of even an ordinary woman&rsquo;s mind&mdash;what great
      male writer would not give two years of his life to sit with them and
      watch them, as the poet watches the flight of a swallow, or the astronomer
      the processions of the sky? A curious gale was raging through the town,
      touzling its thatch of chimney-pots, doing violence to the demureness of
      its respectable streets. Night was falling, and in Piccadilly those
      strange, gay hats that greet the darkness were coming out like eager,
      vulgar comets in a dim and muttering firmament. It was just the moment
      when the outside mood of the huge city begins to undergo a change, to
      glide from its comparative simplicity of afternoon into its leering
      complexity of evening. Each twenty-four hours London has its moment of
      emancipation, its moment in which the wicked begin to breathe and the good
      to wonder, when &ldquo;How?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; are on the lips of the opposing
      factions, and only the philosophers who know&mdash;or think they know&mdash;their
      human nature hold themselves still, and feel that man is at the least
      ceaselessly interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred sat by the fire and held a council. She called her thoughts
      together and gave audience to her suspicions, and her brown eyes were wide
      and rather mournful as her counsellors uttered each a word of hope or of
      warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustace was out. He had gone to a concert, and had not returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was holding a council to decide something in reference to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honeymoon weeks had brought her just as far as the question, &ldquo;Do I
      know my husband at all, or is he, so far, a total stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some people seem to draw near to you as you look at them steadily, others
      to recede until they reach the verge of invisibility. Which was Eustace
      doing? Did his outline become clearer or more blurred? Was he daily more
      definite or more phantasmal? And the members of her council drew near and
      whispered their opinions in Winifred&rsquo;s attentive ears. They were not all
      in accord at the first. Pros fought with cons, elbowed them, were hustled
      in return. Sometimes there was almost a row, and she had to stretch forth
      her hands and hush the tumult. For she desired a calm conclave, although
      she was a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the final decision&mdash;if, indeed, it could be arrived at that
      evening&mdash;was important. Love seemed to hang upon it, and all the
      sweets of life; and the little wings of Love fluttered anxiously, as the
      little wings of a bird flutter when you hold it in the cage of your hands,
      prisoning it from its wayward career through the blue shadows of the
      summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For love is not always and for ever instinctive&mdash;not even the finest
      love. While many women love because they must, whether the thing to be
      loved or not loved be carrion or crystal, a child of the gods or an imp of
      the devil, others love decisively because they see&mdash;perhaps can even
      analyze&mdash;a beauty that is there in the thing before them. One woman
      loves a man simply because he kisses her. Another loves him because he has
      won the Victoria Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred was not of the women who love because they are kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had accepted Eustace rather impulsively, but she had not married him
      quite uncritically. There was something new, different from other men,
      about him which attracted her, as well as his good looks&mdash;that
      prettiness which had peeped out from the white wig in the scarlet nook at
      the ball. His oddities at that time she had grown thoroughly to believe
      in, and, believing in them, she felt she liked them. She supposed them to
      spring, rather like amazing spotted orchids, from the earth of a quaint
      nature. Now, after a honeymoon spent among the orchids, she held this
      council while the wind blew London into a mood of evening irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was Eustace?
    </p>
    <p>
      How the wind sang over Park Lane! Yet the stars were coming out.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he? A genius or a clown? A creature to spread a buttered slide or
      a man to climb to heaven? A fine, free child of Nature, who did, freshly,
      what he would, regardless of the strained discretion of others, or a
      futile, scheming hypocrite, screaming after forced puerilities, without
      even a finger on the skirts of originality?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a problem for lonely woman&rsquo;s debate. Winifred strove to weigh it
      well. In Bluebeard&rsquo;s Chamber Eustace had cut many capers. This activity
      she had expected&mdash;had even wished for. And at first she had been
      amused and entertained by the antics, as one assisting at a good
      burlesque, through which, moreover, a piquant love theme runs. But by
      degrees she began to feel a certain stiffness in the capers, a
      self-consciousness in the antics, or fancied she began to feel it, and
      instead of being always amused she became often thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whimsicality she loved. Buffoonery she possibly, even probably, could
      learn to hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Eustace&rsquo;s love for her she had no doubt. She was certain of his
      affection. But was it worth having? That depended, surely, on the nature
      of the man in whom it sprang, from whom it flowed. She wanted to be sure
      of that nature; but she acknowledged to herself, as she sat by the fire,
      that she was perplexed. Perhaps even that perplexity was merciful. Yet she
      wished to sweep it away. She knit her brows moodily, and longed for a
      secret divining-rod that would twist to reveal truth in another. For
      truth, she thought, is better than hidden water-springs, and a sincerity&mdash;even
      of stupidity&mdash;more lovely than the fountain that gives flowers to the
      desert, wild red roses to the weary gold of sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind roared again, howling to poor, shuddering Mayfair, and there came
      a step outside. Eustace sprang in upon Winifred&rsquo;s council, looking like a
      gay schoolboy, his cheeks flushed, his lips open to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreaming?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That concert paralyzed me. Too much Beethoven. I wanted Wagner. Beethoven
      insists on exalting you, but Wagner lets you revel and feel naughty.
      Winnie, d&rsquo;you hear the wind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I help it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it suggest something to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, and made his expression mischievous, or meant to make
      it. She looked up at him, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, many things,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;many, many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me it suggests kites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kites?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m going to fly one now in the Park. The stars are out. Put on your
      hat and come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed all impulse, sparkling to the novelty of the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one&mdash;a beauty, a monster! I noticed the wind was getting up
      yesterday. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled at her hand; she obeyed him, not quickly. She put on her hat, a
      plain straw, a thick jacket, gloves. Kite-flying in London seemed an odd
      notion. Was it lively and entertaining, or merely silly? Which ought it to
      be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustace shouted to her from the tiny hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind yelled beyond the door, and Winifred ran down, beginning to feel
      a childish thrill of excitement. Eustace held the kite. It was, indeed, a
      white monster, gaily decorated with fluttering scarlet and blue ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be mobbed,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one about,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The gale frightens people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door, and they were out in the crying tempest. The great
      clouds flew along the sky like an army in retreat. Some, to Winifred,
      seemed soldiers, others baggage-waggons, horses, gun-carriages, rushing
      pell-mell for safety. One drooping, tattered cloud she deemed the colours
      of a regiment streaming under the stars that peeped out here and there&mdash;watching
      sentinel eyes, obdurate, till some magic password softened them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they crossed the road she spoke of her cloud army to Eustace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This kite&rsquo;s like a live thing,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;It tugs as a fish tugs a
      line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not care for the tumult of a far-off world.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the Park. It seemed, indeed, strangely deserted. A swaggering
      soldier passed them by, going towards the Marble Arch. His spurs clinked;
      his long cloak gleamed like a huge pink carnation in the dingy dimness of
      the startled night. How he stared with his unintelligent, though bold,
      eyes as he saw the kite bounding to be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustace seemed delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man thinks us mad!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we mad?&rdquo; Winifred asked, surprised at her own strange enjoyment of
      the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; said Eustace, looking at her narrowly. &ldquo;You like this
      escapade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mask!&rdquo; he thought, secretly longing to be quietly by the fire sipping
      tea and reading <i>Punch</i>. &ldquo;She loves that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were through the trees now, across the broad path, out on the open
      lawns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; he shouted, as the wind roared in their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paid out the coils of the thin cord. The white monster skimmed,
      struggled near the ground, returned, darted again upward and outward, felt
      for the wind&rsquo;s hands, caught them and sprang, with a mad courage,
      star-wards, its gay ribbons flying like coloured birds to mark its course.
      But soon they were lost to sight, and only a diminished, ghost-like shadow
      leaping against the black showed where the kite beat on to liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustace ran with the wind, and Winifred followed him. The motion sent an
      exultation dancing through her veins, and stirred her blood into a
      ferment. The noises in the trees, the galloping music of the airs on their
      headlong courses, rang in her ears like clashing bells. She called as she
      ran, but never knew what words. She leaped, as if over glorious obstacles.
      Her feet danced on the short grass. She had a sudden notion: &ldquo;I am living
      now!&rdquo; and Eustace had never seemed so near to her. He had an art to find
      why children are happy, she thought, because they do little strange
      things, coupling mechanical movements, obvious actions that may seem
      absurd, with soft flights of the imagination, that wrap their prancings
      and their leaps in golden robes, and give to the dull world a glory. The
      hoop is their demon enemy, whom they drive before them to destruction. The
      kite is a great white bird, whom they hold back for a time from heaven.
      Suddenly Winifred longed to feel the bird&rsquo;s efforts to be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have it!&rdquo; she cried to Eustace, holding out her hands eagerly. &ldquo;Do
      let me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to pass the cord to her, being utterly tired of a prank which
      he thought idiotic, and he could not understand the light that sprang into
      her eyes as she grasped it, and felt the life of the lifeless thing that
      soared towards the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment it was more to her&mdash;this tugging, scarce visible,
      white thing&mdash;than all the world of souls. It gave to her the
      excitement of battle, the joy of strife. She felt herself a Napoleon with
      empires in her hand; a Diana holding eternities, instead of hounds, in
      leash. She had quite the children&rsquo;s idea of kites, the sense of being in
      touch with the infinite that enters into baby pleasures, and makes the
      remembrance of them live in us when we are old, and have forgotten wild
      passions, strange fruitions, that have followed them and faded away for
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the creature tore at her! She fancied she felt the pulsings of its
      fly-away heart, beating with energy and great hopes of freedom. And
      suddenly, with a call, she opened her hands. Her captive was lost in the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment she felt sad, such a foolish sorrow, as a gaoler may feel sad
      who has grown to love his prisoner, and sees him smile when the gaping
      door gives him again to crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she said to Eustace; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s glad to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad&mdash;a kite!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it struck her that he would have thought it equally sensible if she
      had spoken, like Hans Andersen, of the tragedies of a toy-shop or the
      Homeric passions of wooden dolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, why had he been prompted by the wind to play the boy if he had none
      of the boy&rsquo;s ardent imagination?
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached Deanery Street, and passed in from the night and the
      elements. Eustace shut the door with a sigh of relief. Winifred&rsquo;s echoing
      sigh was of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a listless world&mdash;the world inside a lighted London house,
      dominated by a pale butler with black side-whiskers and endless
      discretion. But Eustace did not feel it so. Winifred knew that beyond hope
      of doubt as she stole a glance at his face. He had put off the child&mdash;the
      buffoon&mdash;and looked for the moment a grave, dull young man, naturally
      at ease with all the conventions. She could not help saying to herself, as
      she went to her room to live with hairpins and her lady&rsquo;s-maid: &ldquo;I believe
      he hated it all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that night of kite-flying Winifred felt differently towards her
      husband. She was of the comparatively rare women who hate pretence even in
      another woman, but especially in a man. The really eccentric she was not
      afraid of&mdash;could even love, being a searcher after the new and
      strange, like so many modern pilgrims. But pinchbeck eccentricity&mdash;Brummagem
      originalities&mdash;gave to her views of the poverty of poor human nature
      leading her to a depression not un-tinged with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the fantasies of Eustace became more violent and more continuous as he
      began to note the lassitude which gradually crept into her intercourse
      with him. London rang with them. At one time he pretended to a strange
      passion for death; prayed to a skull which grinned in a shrine raised for
      it in his dressing-room; lay down each day in a coffin, and asked Winifred
      to close it and scatter earth upon the lid, that he might realize the end
      towards which we journey. He talked of silence, long and loudly&mdash;an
      irony which Winifred duly noted&mdash;sneered at the fleeting phantoms in
      the show of existence, called the sobbing of women, the laughter of men,
      sounds as arid as the whizz of a cracker let off by a child on the fifth
      of November.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should kill our feelings,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They make us absurd. Life should
      be a breathing calm, as death is a breathless calm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The calm descending upon Winifred was of the benumbing order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later he recoiled from this coquetting with the destroyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which of us does not feel himself eternal, exempt
      from the penalty of the race? You don&rsquo;t believe that you will ever die,
      Winifred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think knowledge less real than belief? Perhaps it is. But I, at
      least, hope that some day I shall die. To live on here for ever would be
      like staying eternally at a party. After all, when one has danced, and
      supped, and flirted, and wondered at the gowns, and praised the flowers,
      and touched the hand of one&rsquo;s hostess, and swung round in a final gallop,
      and said how much one has enjoyed it all&mdash;one wants to go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does one?&rdquo; Eustace said. &ldquo;Home you call it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it what I want it to be, what I think it may be, what the poor and
      the weary and the fallen make it in their lonely thoughts. Let us, at
      least, hope that we travel towards the east, where the sun is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have strange fancies,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! Not so strange as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in the eyes as she spoke. He wondered what that look
      meant. It seemed to him a menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must keep it up&mdash;I must keep it up,&rdquo; he murmured to himself as he
      left the room. &ldquo;Winifred loves fancies&mdash;loves me for what she thinks
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to his library, and sat down heavily, to devise fresh outrages on
      the ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pranks became innumerable, and Society called him the most original
      figure of London. The papers quoted him&mdash;his doings, not his sayings.
      People pointed him out in the Park. His celebrity waxed. Even the Marble
      Arch seemed turning to gaze after him as he went by, showing the
      observation which the imaginative think into inanimate things.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, so a wag declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Winifred bore it, but with an increasing impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time, too, a strange need of protection crept over her, the
      yearning for man&rsquo;s beautiful, dog-like sympathy that watches woman in her
      grand dark hour before she blooms into motherhood. When she knew the
      truth, she resolved to tell Eustace, and she came into his room softly,
      with shining eyes. He was sitting reading the Financial News in a nimbus
      of cigarette smoke, secretly glorying in his momentary immunity from the
      prison rules of the fantastic. Winifred&rsquo;s entry was as that of a warder.
      He sprang up laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winnie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I am going to South Africa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she said in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; to give acrobatic performances in the street, and so pave the way to
      a position as a millionaire. Who ever heard of a man rising from a
      respectable competence to a fortune? According to the papers, you must
      start with nothing; that is the first rule of the game. We have ten
      thousand a year, so we can never hope to be rich. Fortune only favours the
      pauper. I am mad about money to-day. I can think of nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he began showing her conjuring tricks with sovereigns which he drew
      from his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not tell him that day. And when she told him, it was without
      apparent emotion. She seemed merely stating coldly a physical fact, not
      breathing out a beautiful secret of her soul and his, a consecrated wonder
      to shake them both, and bind them together as two flowers are bound in the
      centre of a bouquet, the envy of the other flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace,&rdquo; she said, and her eyes were clear and her hands were still, &ldquo;I
      think I ought to tell you&mdash;we shall have a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was unwavering as a doctor&rsquo;s which pronounces, &ldquo;You have the
      influenza.&rdquo; She stood there before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winifred!&rdquo; he cried, looking up. His impulse was to say, &ldquo;Wife! My
      Winifred!&rdquo; to take her in his arms as any clerk might take his little
      middle-class spouse, to kiss her lips, and, in doing it, fancy he drew
      near to the prison in which every soul eternally dwells on earth. Finely
      human he felt, as the dullest, the most unknown, the plainest, the most
      despised, may feel, thank God! &ldquo;Winifred!&rdquo; he cried. And then he stopped,
      with the shooting thought, &ldquo;Even now I must be what she thinks me, what
      she perhaps loves me for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood there silently waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toys!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Toys have always been my besetting sin. Now I will
      make a grand collection, not for the Pope, as people pretend, but for our
      family. You will have two children to laugh at, Winnie. Your husband is
      one, you know.&rdquo; He sprang up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go into the Strand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      a man near the Temple who has always got some delightful novelty
      displaying its paces on the pavement. What fun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And off he went, leaving Winifred alone with the mystery of her woman&rsquo;s
      world, the mystic mystery of birth that may dawn out of hate as out of
      love, out of drunken dissipation as out of purity&rsquo;s sweet climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day a paragraph in the papers told how Mr. Eustace Lane had bought up
      all the penny toys of the Strand. Mention was again made of his supposed
      mission to the Vatican, and a picture drawn of the bewilderment of the
      Holy Father, roused from contemplation of the eternal to contemplation of
      jumping pasteboard, and the frigid gestures of people from the world of <i>papier-mache</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustace showed the paragraph to Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why will they chronicle all I do?&rdquo; he said, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you rather they did not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if it amuses them,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;To amuse the world is to be its
      benefactor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, to comfort the world,&rdquo; was Winifred&rsquo;s silent thought. .
    </p>
    <p>
      To her the world often seemed a weary invalid, playing cards on the
      coverlet of the bed from which it longed in vain to move, peeping with
      heavy eyes at the shrouded windows of its chamber, and listening for faint
      sounds from without&mdash;soft songs, soft murmurings, the breath of
      winds, the sigh of showers; then turning with a smothered groan to its
      cards again, its lengthy game of &ldquo;Patience.&rdquo; Clubs, spades, hearts,
      diamonds&mdash;there they all lay on the coverlet ready to the hands of
      the invalid. But she wanted to take them away, and give to the sufferer a
      prayer and a hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period she was often full of a vague, chaotic tenderness,
      far-reaching, yet indefinite. She could rather have kissed the race than a
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the days went by, Winifred in a dream of wonder, Eustace in the
      toy-shops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the birthday dawned and faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through that day Eustace was in agony. He did not care so much for the
      child, but he loved the mother. Her danger tore at his heart. Her pain
      smote him, till he seemed to feel it actually and physically. That she was
      giving him something was naught to him; that she might be taken away in
      the giving was everything. And when he learnt that all was well, he cried
      and prayed, and thought to himself afterwards, &ldquo;If Winifred could know
      what I am like, what I have done to-day, how would it strike her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not know; for when at length Eustace was admitted to her room, he
      trained himself to murmur, &ldquo;A girl, that&rsquo;s lucky because of all the dolls.
      The Pope sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have even one now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred lay back white on her pillow, and a little frown travelled across
      her face. If Eustace had just kissed her, and she had felt a tear of his
      on her face, and he had said nothing, she could have loved him then as a
      father, perhaps, more than as a husband. His allusion to the supposed
      Papal absurdity disgusted her at such a time, only faintly, because of her
      weakness, but distinctly, and in a way to be remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recovered; but just as the child was beginning to smile, and to
      express an approbation of life by murmurous gurglings, an infantile
      disease gripped it, held it, would not release it. And Winifred knelt
      beside it, dead, and thought, with a new and vital horror, of the invalid
      world playing cards upon the drawn coverlet of its bed. Baby was outside
      that chamber now, beyond the curtained windows, outside in sun or shower
      that she could not see, could only dream of, while the game of &ldquo;Patience&rdquo;
       went on and on.
    </p>

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The death of the child meant more to Winifred than she would at first
      acknowledge even to herself. Almost unconsciously she had looked forward
      to its birth as to a release from bondage. There are moments when a duet
      is gaol, a trio comparative liberty. The child, the tiny intruder into
      youthful married life, may come in the guise of an imp or of a good fairy:
      one to cloud the perfect and complete joy of two, or one to give sunlight
      to their nascent weariness and dissatisfaction. Or, again, it may be
      looked for with longing by one of two lovers, with apprehension by the
      other. Only when it lay dead did Winifred understand that Eustace was to
      her a stranger, and that she was lonely alone with him. The &ldquo;Au revoir&rdquo; of
      two bodies may be sweet, but the &ldquo;Au revoir&rdquo; of two minds is generally but
      a hypocritical or sarcastic rendering of the tragic word &ldquo;Adieu.&rdquo;
       Winifred&rsquo;s mind cried &ldquo;Au revoir&rdquo; to the mind of Eustace, to his nature,
      to his love, but deep in her soul trembled the minor music, the shuddering
      discord, of &ldquo;Adieu.&rdquo; Adieu to the body of child; adieu more complete, more
      eternal, to the soul of husband. Which good bye was the stranger? She
      stood as at cross-roads, and watched, with hand-shaded eyes, the tiny,
      wayward babe dwindling on its journey to heaven; the man she had married
      dwindling on his journey&mdash;whither? And the one she had a full hope of
      meeting again, but the other&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the funeral the Lanes took up once more the old dual life which had
      been momentarily interrupted. Had it not been for the interruption,
      Winifred fancied that she might not have awakened to the full knowledge of
      her own feelings towards Eustace until a much later period. But the baby&rsquo;s
      birth, existence, passing away, were a blow upon the gate of life from the
      vague without. She had opened the gate, caught a glimpse of the shadowy
      land of the possible. And to do that is often to realize in a flash the
      impossibility of one&rsquo;s individual fate. So many of us manage to live
      ignorantly all our days and to call ourselves happy. Winifred could never
      live quite ignorantly again.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Eustace the interruption meant much less. So long as he had Winifred he
      could not feel that any of his dreams hung altogether in tatters.
      Sometimes, it is true, he contemplated the penny toys, and had a moment of
      quaint, not unpleasant regret, half forming the thought, Why do we ever
      trouble ourselves to prepare happiness for others, when happiness is a
      word of a thousand meanings? As often as not, to do so is to set a dinner
      of many courses and many wines before an unknown guest, who proves to be
      vegetarian and teetotaler, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do with the toys?&rdquo; he asked Winifred one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The toys? Oh, give them to a children&rsquo;s hospital,&rdquo; she said, and her
      voice had a harsh note in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep them and play
      with them myself; you know I love toys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on the following Sunday, when many callers came to Deanery Street,
      they found him in the drawing-room, playing with a Noah&rsquo;s ark. Red, green,
      violet, and azure elephants, antelopes, zebras, and pigs processed along
      the carpet, guided by an orange-coloured Noah in a purple top-hat, and a
      perfect parterre of sons and wives. The fixed anxiety of their painted
      faces suggested that they were in apprehension of the flood, but their
      rigid attitudes implied trust in the Unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred&rsquo;s face that day seemed changed to those who knew her best. To one
      man, a soldier who had admired her greatly before her marriage, and\who
      had seen no reason to change his opinion of her since, she was more
      cordial than usual, and he went away curiously meditating on the mystery
      of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened to Mrs. Lane?&rdquo; he thought to himself as he walked down
      Park Lane. &ldquo;That last look of hers at me, when I was by the door, going,
      was&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll swear it&mdash;Regent Street. And yet Winnie Lane is
      the purest&mdash;I&rsquo;m hanged if I can make out women! Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll go there
      again. People say she and that fantastic ass she&rsquo;s married are devoted.
      H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; He went to Pall Mall, and sat staring at nothing in his Club till
      seven, deep in the mystery of the female sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went again to Deanery Street to see whether the vision of Regent
      Street was deceptive, and came away wondering and hoping. From this time
      the vagaries of Eustace Lane became more incessant, more flamboyant, than
      ever, and Mrs. Lane was perpetually in society. If it would not have been
      true to say, conventionally, that no party was complete without her, yet
      it certainly seemed, from this time, that she was incomplete without a
      party. She was the starving wolf after the sledge in which sat the gay
      world. If the sledge escaped her, she was left to face darkness, snow,
      wintry winds, loneliness. In London do we not often hear the dismal
      howling of the wolves, suggesting steppes of the heart frigid as Siberia?
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustace grew uneasy, for Winifred seemed eluding him in this maze of
      entertainments. He could not impress the personality of his mask upon her
      vitally when she moved perpetually in the pantomime processions of
      society, surrounded by grotesques, mimes, dancers, and deformities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are scarcely ever alone, Winnie,&rdquo; he said to her one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must learn to love me in a crowd,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Human nature can
      love even God in isolation, but the man who can love God in the world is
      the true Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can love you anywhere,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And
      then he stopped and quickly readjusted his mask which was slipping off.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day he monotonously accentuated his absurdities. All London rang
      with them. He was the Court Fool of Mayfair, the buffoon of the inner
      circles of the Metropolis, and, by degrees, his painted fame, jangling the
      bells in its cap, spun about England in a dervish dance, till Peckham
      whispered of him, and even the remotest suburbs crowned him with parsley
      and hung upon his doings. All the blooming flowers of notoriety were his,
      to hug in his arms as he stood upon his platform bowing to the general
      applause. His shrine in <i>Vanity Fair</i> was surely being prepared. But
      he scarcely thought of this, being that ordinary, ridiculous, middle-class
      thing, an immoderately loving husband, insane enough to worship
      romantically the woman to whom he was unromantically tied by the law of
      his country. With each new fantasy he hoped to win back that which he had
      lost. Each joke was the throw of a desperate gamester, each tricky
      invention a stake placed on the number that would never turn up. That wild
      time of his career was humorous to the world, how tragic to himself we can
      only wonder. He spread wings like a bird, flew hither and thither as if a
      vagrant for pure joy and the pleasure of movement, darted and poised,
      circled and sailed, but all the time his heart cried aloud for a nest and
      Winifred. Yet he wooed her only silently by his follies, and set her each
      day farther and farther from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she&mdash;how she hated his notoriety, and was sick with weariness
      when voices told her of his escapades, modulating themselves to wondering
      praise. Long ago she had known that Eustace sinned against his own nature,
      but she had never loved him quite enough to discover what that nature
      really was. And now she had no desire to find out. He was only her husband
      and the least of all men to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lanes sat at breakfast one morning and took up their letters. Winifred
      sipped her tea, and opened one or two carelessly. They were invitations.
      Then she tore, the envelope of a third, and, as she read it, forgot to sip
      her tea. Presently she laid it down slowly. Eustace was looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winifred,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have got a letter from the editor of <i>Vanity
      Fair</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wishes me to permit a caricature of myself to appear in his pages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred&rsquo;s fingers closed sharply on the letter she had just been reading.
      A decision of hers in regard to the writer of it was hanging in the
      balance, though Eustace did not know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Eustace, inquiring of her silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to reply?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wondering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She chipped an eggshell and took a bit of dry toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All those who appear in <i>Vanity Fair</i> are celebrated, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Eustace said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For many different things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you refuse the editor&rsquo;s request?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Tell me when you have written to him, and what you have written,
      Eustace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Winnie, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later on in the day he came up to her boudoir, and said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told him I am quite willing to have my caricature in his paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your portrait,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All right. Leave me now, Eustace; I have some
      writing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had gone she sat down and wrote a short letter, which she
      posted herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month later Eustace came bounding up the stairs to find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winnie, Winnie!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Where are you? I&rsquo;ve something to show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held a newspaper in his hand. Winifred was not in the room. Eustace
      rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Lane?&rdquo; he asked of the footman who answered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone out, sir,&rdquo; the man answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not back yet? It&rsquo;s very late,&rdquo; said Eustace, looking at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time was a quarter to eight. They were dining at half-past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder where she is,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat down and gazed at a cartoon which represented a thin man with
      a preternaturally pale face, legs like sticks, and drooping hands full of
      toys&mdash;himself. Beneath it was written, &ldquo;His aim is to amuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned a page, and read, for the third or fourth time, the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Eustace Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Eustace Bernhard Lane, only son of Mr. Merton Lane, of Carlton House
      Terrace, was born in London twenty-eight years ago. He is married to one
      of the belles of the day, and is probably the most envied husband in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although he is such a noted figure in society, Mr. Eustace Lane has never
      done any conspicuously good or bad deed. He has neither invented a bicycle
      nor written a novel, neither lost a seat in Parliament, nor found a mine
      in South Africa. Careless of elevating the world, he has been content to
      entertain it, to make it laugh, or to make it wonder. His aim is to amuse,
      and his whole-souled endeavour to succeed in this ambition has gained him
      the entire respect of the frivolous. What more could man desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he finished there came a ring at the hall-door bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winifred!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and jumped up with the paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the footman entered with a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boy messenger has just brought this, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustace took it, and, as the man went out and shut the door, opened it,
      and read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Victoria Station.

     &ldquo;This is to say good-bye. By the time it reaches you I
     shall have left London. Not alone. I have seen the cartoon.
     It is very like you.
     Winifred.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Eustace sank down in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the table at his elbow lay <i>Vanity Fair</i>. Mechanically he looked
      at it, and read once more the words beneath his picture, &ldquo;His aim is to
      amuse.&rdquo;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
